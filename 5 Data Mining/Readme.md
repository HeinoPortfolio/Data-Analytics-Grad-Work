# Course Overview

This is the repository for the Data Mining I course. This page will contain the coursework files that are completed during the course.  You will find sample code that was used to create the assignment and a brief description of the concepts or technology used to pass the assessment. 

# Competencies
- Classification data mining models
- Data mining performance
- Predictive mining models
- Data mining model performance

# Assessment Objectives
- Classification and prediction.
- Create a K-nearest neighbors model (KNN).
- Create a Decision Tree Regressor.
- Clean the data for use in the model.
- Be able to identify independent and dependent variables that are applicable to a question.
- Data transformation, transforming data into a form that cn be used on a linear regression.

# Technologies and Concepts Used
The concepts and technologies used to create and complete the assessment are the following:
- Creation of a K-Nearest Neighbors modl
- Creation of a Decision Tree Regressor.
- Data cleaning and transformation.
- Feature Selection
- AUC and ROC graphs
