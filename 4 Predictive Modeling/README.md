# Course Overview

This is the repository for the Predictive Modeling course. This page will contain the coursework files that are completed during the course.  You will find a sample code that was used to create the assignment and a brief description of the concepts or technology used to pass the assessment. 

# Competencies
- To be able to create logistic and linear regressions.
- Create multiple regressions
- Understand the implications of the regressions.

# Assessment Objectives
- Create a suitable research question based on the dataset.
- Prepare data (data prpeparation) to allow for analysis and the creation of the appropriate regression.
- Transform or encode data to make usre they data is in the right form for use.
- Perform the a model comparison and analysis for the regression models.
- Summarize the findings and the data within the model.
- Understand multicollinearity.

# Technologies and Concepts Used
The concepts and technologies used to create and complete the assessment are the following:
- Multiple regressions
- Creation of training and testing set
- Use of the concept of the variance inflation factor (VIF)
- Model reduction
- Model's residual standard error (RSE)
