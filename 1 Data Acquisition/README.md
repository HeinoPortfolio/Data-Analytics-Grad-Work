# Course Overview

This is the repository for the Data Acquisition course. This page will contain the coursework files that are completed during the course.  You will find a sample code that was used to create the assignment and a brief description of the concepts or technology used to pass the assessment. 

# Competencies
- The ability to analyze data for its dimensionality, the quality of the data, and the limitations of the data.
- Develop the ability to create data models that accurately represents the data found within a dataset.
- The ability to use SQL (PostgreSQL) to manipulate, create, and update the data within the database.  This is accomplished through the proper use of the correct queries.

# Assessment Objectives
- To develop a research question that can be answered with the given datasets.  Two datasets will be used in the assessment.  One is given and the other is an add-on dataset.  This question is stated in the PDF that is found in this repository.
- Creation of an entity relationship diagram (ERD).  This diagram can be found in the written document.
- Create the appropriate code for creating a table for the addon dataset as well as the appropriate code to create the addon table in the database.

# Technologies and Concepts Used
The concepts and technologies used to create and complete the assessment are the following:
- Use of SQL to create the appropriate queries.
- The ability to navigate PGAdmin 4 to create queries and view the tables within the database.
- The ability to load a CSV file into a table using the appropriate commands.
- Using Postgres as the database management system.
