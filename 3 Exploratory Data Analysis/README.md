# Course Overview

This is the repository for the Exploratory Data Analysis course. This page will contain the coursework files that are completed during the course.  You will find a sample code that was used to create the assignment and a brief description of the concepts or technology used to pass the assessment. 

# Competencies
- The ability to interpret data.
- To be able to conduct parametric testing.
- The ability to manipulate data for analysis.

# Assessment Objectives
- To develop a research question that can be answered with the given dataset. Identify a real-world organzational issue.
- Describe the data using a t-test.
- Identify the distribution of two continuous variables and two categorical variables using univariate statistics. 
- Identify the distribution of two continuous variables and two categorical variables using bivariate statistics.
- Creation and development of a hypothesis test.

# Technologies and Concepts Used
The concepts and technologies used to create and complete the assessment are the following:
- Use of Python to explore the dataset.
- Creation of univariate and bivariate statistics.
